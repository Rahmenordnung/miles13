					<h3>3</h3>
					<p>The Simpsons "are an average American family. There are always new stories to tell about Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie and about the other residents of Springfield.

Homer is the man in the house, but not exactly how one imagines him, yet his wife, Marge loves him and he loves her. He prefers Moe's Tavern, his favorite pub, where he drinks his beloved Duff beer with his drinking buddies. Otherwise, he just sits in front of the TV and eats chips or something unhealthy. He works - well, rather he just sits around and does nothing - in the nuclear power plant.

Marge works a lot in the household. Striking to her are her blue hair, which she has pinned up to a tower hairstyle and her croaking voice.</p>

					<p>Marge works a lot in the household. Striking to her are her blue hair, which she has pinned up to a tower hairstyle and her croaking voice.

Bart is cheeky and always has a fitting saying in stock, which also has the consequence that he is bad at school and always does what he should not do.

Lisa is very gifted, plays the saxophone and only writes 1's.

					<p>Maggie, the little baby, can not talk yet and is always sucking on her pacifier.

But there are also many secondary characters that appear again and again, such as Abraham, called Grampa Simpson, who often falls into a coma and wakes up again, Moe the bartender, who has problems with women and whose best customer Barney Gumble is, the drunkard who does absolutely nothing or Barts friend Milhouse van Houten, the is incredibly in love with Lisa and is always beaten by Nelson Muntz, which in turn turns many crooked things with his buddies.The series also lives on in part by these hilarious minor characters, some of whom do not even have a real place in Springfield, home of the Simpsons, but nonetheless keep popping up, like Gill, the unsuccessful salesman who's constantly trying to turn people into useless stuff but always blabbed or Kang and Konos, the two aliens who try to take over the world, but are usually somehow unable to do so.
